Project Overview:
Doyen Autos, a dynamic auto sales company in Lagos, Nigeria, is launching a bold initiative to promote electric vehicles (EVs) and champion sustainable mobility. Embodying a sleek Gen-Z persona, Doyen Autos is committed to leading the charge towards a greener, more innovative automotive culture in Nigeria. This project aims to position Doyen Autos as the go-to brand for EVs, raise awareness about their benefits, and inspire a new generation of eco-conscious drivers.
Project Objectives:
	•	Establish Doyen Autos as the leading advocate for EV adoption in Nigeria.
	•	Create compelling, educational, and visually striking content that resonates with Gen-Z and young professionals.
	•	Showcase Doyen Autos’ commitment to sustainability and innovation in the Nigerian auto industry.
	•	Foster a vibrant, green automotive culture through community engagement, digital campaigns, and strategic partnerships.
Branding Guidelines:
	•	Visual Style: Modern, clean, and professional, yet approachable. Use strong, sans-serif fonts with a slightly futuristic edge.
	•	Color Palette: Deep Navy or Metallic Blue (trust, sophistication), Silver or Charcoal Gray (modern elegance), with optional accents of Nigerian Green for local identity.
	•	Iconography: Incorporate abstract car silhouettes, steering wheels, speedometers, or a bold “D” shaped like a car front/road bend. Subtle local cultural nuances (e.g., Yoruba patterns) are encouraged.
	•	Logo Usage: Ensure scalability and clarity in all formats-digital, print, merchandise, and signage. Logo should work with or without the “Autos” text.
Key Deliverables:
	•	A multi-channel digital campaign (social media, website, email) highlighting the benefits of EVs and Doyen Autos’ leadership in sustainable mobility.
	•	Branded visuals and content for car decals, showroom signage, uniforms, and merchandise.
	•	Educational materials (infographics, videos, blog posts) demystifying EV technology and addressing local concerns (charging, cost, maintenance).
	•	Event concepts or partnerships (e.g., EV test drive days, sustainability forums) to engage the Lagos community.
Tone & Messaging:
	•	Confident, energetic, and future-forward-speak directly to Gen-Z and young professionals.
	•	Emphasize innovation, eco-friendliness, and local pride.
	•	Use clear, simple language and bold visuals to break down complex EV topics.
Success Metrics:
	•	Increased brand awareness and positive sentiment among target demographics.
	•	Growth in digital engagement (followers, shares, comments).
	•	Measurable rise in EV inquiries and showroom visits.
	•	Community participation in Doyen Autos’ sustainability initiatives.
Creative Inspiration:
Look to brands like Toyota (subtle, symmetrical design), BMW (heritage meets modern), and Bolt (clean font, local relevance) for inspiration, but ensure Doyen Autos stands out with its unique blend of Gen-Z energy and Nigerian identity.
BOLT, your mission:
Bring Doyen Autos’ vision to life by crafting a campaign that’s as electrifying as the vehicles it promotes. Fuse style with substance, and make Doyen Autos the symbol of Nigeria’s green automotive future.
